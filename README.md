🎨 About Me

🌙 I’m made of metaphors, strong coffee, and soft promises.
🦊 A little fox wandering between code, paintbrushes, and daydreams.
🧠 I study Psychology and adore exploring the human mind with a touch of art.
💻 I create small worlds in Python, HTML, CSS — and sometimes in dreams.

💖 Things I Love

Turning feelings into code or illustrations

Indie games, gentle beats, and cinnamon-spiced coffee

Git commits that read like love notes

Exploring the human soul as if it were a galaxy waiting to be mapped
